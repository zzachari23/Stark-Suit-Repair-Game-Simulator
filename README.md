# Stark-Suit-Repair-Game-Simulator

## About The Project

The overall purpose of the program is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language such as Rust. The program mimics a mini game simulator based on the Marvel super hero Tony Stark aka Iron Man. A min heap priority queue data structure is used to house Stark's enemies and their locations which are originally stored in hashmaps. The program then utilizes Breadth-first search and Depth-first traversal algorithms to traverse through the nodes of the min heap to help Stark's suit determine which enemy Stark must fight in larger battles to win in the most efficient and quickest way. In addition, Enums are used to help Stark communicate with his suit where his commands are transalted into strings.
